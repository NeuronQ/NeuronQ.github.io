              desc: |
                I've used the Laravel PHP framework (up to v5.2) in a
                production setting in a number of projects, some started from scratch
                by me, others maintained and expanded. This is the framework I'm most
                confortable with from the PHP ecosystem, but I'm confident that I can
                easily generalize the concepts and experience to any other framework I will
                need to work with.

                <strong>Javascript</strong>
              desc: |
                I've used Node.js in a few small projects, and it is becoming my favorite platform for starting new web apps.
                Express is a simple no-frills framework for getting things done and the
                "new Javascript" brought by ES6 together with TypeScript are much more
                productive and enjoyable for me than PHP, even with the advancements
                brought by PHP 7.
            - name: <span class="devicons devicons-django"></span> Django
              language: <span class="devicons devicons-python"></span> <strong>Python</strong>
              desc: |
                Python is one of the languages I feel most productive in and Django is a
                very pragmatic web framework that has evolved and kept up with the new
                technologies and at the same time remained stable and well documented. I've
                used Django professionally but nowadays I prefer Node.js for web apps and
                I use Python for scraping, data-mining learning AI/ML.
            - name: <span class="devicons devicons-ruby_on_rails"></span> Ruby on Rails
              language: <span class="devicons devicons-ruby"></span> <strong>Ruby</strong>
              desc: |
                Ruby on Rails is the framework that first introduced me to "classic web MVC architecture" years ago, and I've applied the lessons from it while working
                in other languages and frameworks. But I'm not a "Ruby developer" and I
                don't really have experience working with Rails in production.

              desc: |
                I've worked extensibly with WordPress, developing <strong>custom plugins</strong>,
                <strong>custom themes</strong>, using it as "framework-CMS" at the basis of
                complex applications, as a "content translations UI" for web-apps developed in
                frameworks like Laravel, and I've also investigated using it via API to power
                SPAs developed outside WP. <strong>WP is not my favorite platform</strong>
                nowdays, but I can recognize situations where it is the right tool for the job
                and I can use it appropriately.
            - name: <span class="devicons devicons-django lead-icon"></span> DjangoCMS
              desc: |
                I've used DjangoCMS in a project that required a WordPress-like (from the user's
                perspective) CMS on top of a Django-baseb web application. It's a stable and
                extensible platform that can spare a lot of development effort.

      content: |
        <p>I'm passionate about the fields of Machine Learning and AI and I'm broadly familiarity
        with the general principles and basic terminology. I've player with some of the Python
        machine learning toolkits like SciPy and NLTK and with NumPy that underlies them. I'm
        currently going through Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree, at a semi-self-paced rate, in my free time.
        And I also read about all the recent developemnts
        in the AI field.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>I've developed a very small application implementing a map-reduce
        job in Python using mrjob framework, and ran the application on an AWS EMR
        Hadoop cluster that I've set up, in order to process the Common Crawl
        archive datasets and extract specific data about crawled ecommerce
        websites.</p>

        <p>I'm currently working to implement a few personal Android app ideas and at the
        same time learning Android development and brushing off my rusty
        Java programming skills :)</p>
    - title: Tech Team Leadership & Project Management
      content: |
        <p>I've been a <strong>team-leader for very small teams (up to 4 developers)</strong> in a
        startup-style environment. By taking responsibility for the projects, coordinating
        with members of other teams (Marketing and Customer Support), participating in recruitment,
        project planning and reporting directly with to the company owners I fullfilled the role
        of a small team project manager combined with that of tech lead.</p>
        <p>As a <strong>technical co-founder in a small startup</strong> I've been put again in the
        position of functioning both as a lead-developer and project manager.</p>
    - title: Product Development (SaaS)
      content: |
        <p>As a technical co-founder in a SaaS startup, I've been involved in all the stages of
        <strong>product development</strong>, from idea to development and design specifications.</p>
    - title: UX & UI design
      content: |
        <p>Even though I a developer at core, I like to participate in meetings about UX and UI design.
        I'm confortable working with wireframing tools like <strong>Balsamiq</strong> and
        <strong>Moqups</strong> and with graphic design tools like <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>
        and <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong>.</p>
        <p>I'd like to think that I have passable graphic design skills from the early days when I used
        to do design+branding+development web projects, but nowadays I always prefer to leave all graphic
        design work to the real professionals :)</p>
